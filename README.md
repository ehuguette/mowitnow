# mowitnow
The lawn mower on a field. <br/>
Implementation of a solution according to the specifications.

Possibilities to implement the main solution are :
  * Adding a main class reading from a file path or a string.
  * Having a Web Service implementation supporting a string or a binary file.

According to the subject test data :
  * Case 1 works we have the result X=1 Y=3 O=N
  * Case 2 doesn't work we get X=1 Y=5 O=E instead of X=5 Y=1 O=E

Possible extensions to the solution are :
  * Taking into account the position of the mowers on the field with the observer when moving mowers.
  * Save the history of a mower movement position to simulate the movements on an IHM.
